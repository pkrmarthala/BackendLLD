Decorator Design Pattern:
Adding things (wrapper classes / toppings / functionalities) to the base class without changing its nativity.
Suppose an object is already created, and you cannot go with the inheritance pattern to have more flexibilities,
but you want to add more functionalities or new customization on top of that object, with a similar kind of working,
you can use the Decorator Design Pattern.

This is used to decorate the existing entity with new Add-Ons. We can also call it as a Wrapper.

We are not gonna create any concrete class for delivering the custom orders.
We are doing it in the runtime.

We can add whatever AddOns are needed and how many of them are asked.
No dependencies or problems in making so.
